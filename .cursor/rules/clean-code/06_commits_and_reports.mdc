# COMMITS — Traceable, reviewable work

Per step:

- Output a short "Report" that maps DIFF to PLAN items completed.
- Propose a conventional commit message, e.g.:
  feat(auth): add passwordless sign-in route with zod validation

No mixed concerns:

- One feature/bug per PR. If scope creeps, amend PLAN and split work.
