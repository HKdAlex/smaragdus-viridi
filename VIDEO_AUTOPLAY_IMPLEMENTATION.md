# Video Autoplay Implementation

## Summary

Implemented muted autoplay with loop functionality for videos in the gemstone detail page galleries, both in thumbnail preview and main view.

## Changes Made

### File Modified

- `src/features/gemstones/components/media-gallery.tsx`

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Main Gallery Video (Lines 233-246)

Added the following attributes to the main video element:

- `autoPlay`: Videos start playing automatically when displayed
- `loop`: Videos continuously loop without stopping
- `playsInline`: Ensures videos play inline on iOS devices (prevents fullscreen)
- Kept `muted={isVideoMuted}`: Starts muted by default (required for autoplay to work in browsers)

#### 2. Thumbnail Video Preview (Lines 407-414)

Replaced the static thumbnail image with an actual autoplaying video preview:

- Videos in thumbnails now autoplay, loop, and are muted
- Provides a "living preview" of the video content before clicking
- Uses `object-cover` for proper thumbnail sizing
- Kept the play icon overlay for visual indication

#### 3. State Management Updates

- **Initial State (Line 98)**: Changed `isVideoPlaying` initial state to `true` since videos autoplay
- **Effect Hook (Line 190)**: Updated to set `isVideoPlaying` to `true` when switching to a video
- **Navigation Functions (Lines 147-160)**: Removed manual `setIsVideoPlaying(false)` calls, letting the effect hook handle video state

## User Experience Improvements

### Before

- Videos required manual play button click in both main view and thumbnails
- Thumbnails showed static poster images or fallback icons
- Required user interaction to see video content

### After

- Videos autoplay immediately when displayed (muted)
- Thumbnail strip shows live video previews, creating a dynamic gallery
- Users can still toggle sound on/off using the mute button
- Videos loop continuously for seamless viewing
- Maintains browser autoplay policies by starting muted

## Browser Compatibility

- `autoPlay` + `muted`: Works in all modern browsers
- `playsInline`: Ensures proper behavior on iOS Safari
- `loop`: Standard HTML5 video attribute, universally supported

## Technical Notes

### Why Muted?

Modern browsers block autoplay with sound to prevent intrusive user experiences. By defaulting to muted, we ensure autoplay works reliably while giving users the option to enable sound.

### Performance Considerations

- Videos in thumbnails are small (80x80px) and will use minimal bandwidth
- The `playsInline` attribute prevents iOS from forcing fullscreen mode
- Loop attribute eliminates loading delays between plays

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Videos autoplay in main gallery view
- [ ] Videos autoplay in thumbnail strip
- [ ] Clicking a video thumbnail displays it in main view (autoplaying)
- [ ] Sound toggle works correctly
- [ ] Videos loop seamlessly
- [ ] Navigation between media items works smoothly
- [ ] Mobile behavior (iOS/Android) works as expected
- [ ] Lightbox video still autoplays (already implemented)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add user preference to disable autoplay globally
- Implement lazy loading for thumbnail videos
- Add data-saver mode detection
- Consider preload strategies for better performance
