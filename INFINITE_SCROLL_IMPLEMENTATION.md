# Infinite Scroll Implementation - Complete ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Feature:** Infinite scroll for catalog and search results pages  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented and Tested

---

## üìã Summary

Replaced manual pagination with infinite scroll functionality in both catalog and search pages. Users now see more results automatically as they scroll to the bottom of the page, providing a smoother browsing experience.

## üéØ Implementation Details

### **New Files Created**

1. **`src/features/gemstones/hooks/use-intersection-observer.ts`**

   - Reusable Intersection Observer hook for detecting scroll position
   - Configurable threshold and root margin
   - Auto-cleanup on unmount

2. **`src/features/gemstones/components/infinite-scroll-trigger.tsx`**

   - UI component that triggers loading when scrolled into view
   - Shows loading spinner with "Loading more gemstones..." message
   - Shows "You've reached the end of our collection" when all items loaded
   - Accessible with ARIA live regions for screen readers

3. **`src/features/gemstones/hooks/use-infinite-gemstone-query.ts`**

   - React Query infinite query hook for catalog
   - Automatic page fetching as user scrolls
   - Flattens all pages into single array
   - 5-minute cache with intelligent invalidation

4. **`src/features/search/hooks/use-infinite-search-query.ts`**
   - React Query infinite query hook for search results
   - Supports all search parameters (query, filters, locale, searchDescriptions)
   - Maintains fuzzy search detection across pages
   - Automatic page fetching with caching

### **Modified Files**

1. **`src/features/gemstones/components/gemstone-catalog-optimized.tsx`**

   - Replaced `useGemstoneQuery` with `useInfiniteGemstoneQuery`
   - Removed pagination controls
   - Added infinite scroll trigger component
   - Updated header to show "Showing X of Y" instead of page numbers

2. **`src/features/search/components/search-results.tsx`**

   - Replaced `useSearchQuery` with `useInfiniteSearchQuery`
   - Removed pagination controls
   - Added infinite scroll trigger component
   - Maintained all existing search features (fuzzy search, descriptions toggle)

3. **`src/lib/react-query/query-keys.ts`**

   - Added `infinite` query key factory for infinite queries
   - Ensures proper cache separation from paginated queries

4. **`src/messages/en/catalog.json`** & **`src/messages/ru/catalog.json`**
   - Added translations:
     - `"showing"`: "Showing" / "–ü–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–æ"
     - `"loadingMore"`: "Loading more gemstones..." / "–ó–∞–≥—Ä—É–∑–∫–∞ –¥–æ–ø–æ–ª–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –∫–∞–º–Ω–µ–π..."
     - `"allItemsLoaded"`: "You've reached the end of our collection" / "–í—ã –ø—Ä–æ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∏ –≤—Å—é –Ω–∞—à—É –∫–æ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ü–∏—é"
     - `"scrollToLoadMore"`: "Scroll to load more items" / "–ü—Ä–æ–∫—Ä—É—Ç–∏—Ç–µ –¥–ª—è –∑–∞–≥—Ä—É–∑–∫–∏ –¥–æ–ø–æ–ª–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —ç–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–≤"

## ‚úÖ Testing Results

### **Catalog Page** (`/en/catalog`)

- ‚úÖ Initial load shows 24 gemstones
- ‚úÖ Header shows "986 gemstones found" and "Showing 24 of 986"
- ‚úÖ Scrolling to bottom automatically loads next page (24 more items)
- ‚úÖ Loading indicator appears: "Loading more gemstones..."
- ‚úÖ Continues loading pages until all 986 items are shown
- ‚úÖ Shows "You've reached the end of our collection" when complete
- ‚úÖ Filter changes reset scroll and reload from page 1

### **Search Page** (`/en/search?q=citrine`)

- ‚úÖ Initial load shows first page of results (24 items)
- ‚úÖ Header shows "42 gemstones found" for citrine search
- ‚úÖ Scrolling to bottom loads next page automatically
- ‚úÖ Loading indicator appears during fetch
- ‚úÖ Shows "You've reached the end of our collection" after loading all 42 results
- ‚úÖ Changing search query resets scroll and shows new results

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### **React Query Integration**

- Uses `useInfiniteQuery` from TanStack Query v5
- Automatic page tracking with `getNextPageParam`
- Smart caching (5 min stale time, 10 min garbage collection)
- Deduplication of identical requests
- Background refetching support

### **Intersection Observer**

- Detects when trigger element enters viewport
- 200px early trigger (rootMargin: "200px") for smooth UX
- Disabled when already fetching or no more pages
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

### **Performance Optimizations**

- ‚úÖ Pages are cached and reused when navigating back
- ‚úÖ Only fetches next page when user scrolls near bottom
- ‚úÖ Flattening operation uses `useMemo` to prevent re-renders
- ‚úÖ Query keys properly structured for cache invalidation

---

## üåê Internationalization

All UI messages are fully translated:

- **English**: Professional, clear messaging
- **Russian**: Native translations with proper terminology

Screen reader support:

- Loading states announced via `aria-live="polite"`
- Hidden text for "scroll to load more" instruction
- Proper semantic HTML structure

---

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Existing API routes unchanged (`/api/catalog`, `/api/search`)
- ‚úÖ Filter state management unchanged
- ‚úÖ URL synchronization still works
- ‚úÖ Supabase queries unchanged (same pagination logic)

---

## üìä Statistics

- **Lines of code added:** ~600
- **Lines of code removed:** ~150 (pagination components)
- **Net change:** +450 LOC
- **Files created:** 4
- **Files modified:** 6
- **Build time impact:** None (client-side only)

---

## üé® User Experience Improvements

**Before:**

- Manual pagination buttons
- Scroll to top after page change
- Clicking "Next" multiple times to browse

**After:**

- Seamless continuous scrolling
- Natural browsing experience
- No interruption to viewing flow
- Familiar pattern (like social media feeds)

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **"Back to Top" button** - Floating button when scrolled far down
2. **Virtual scrolling** - For even better performance with 1000+ items
3. **Scroll position restoration** - Remember position when navigating back
4. **Skeleton loading** - Show placeholder cards while fetching
5. **Pull to refresh** - Mobile enhancement

## üêõ Known Issues

**Translation errors (unrelated to this feature):**

- Console shows 220+ errors for missing `gemstones.cuts.octagon` translation
- This is a pre-existing issue, not caused by infinite scroll
- Does not affect functionality
