## 🔄 Browser Testing (In Progress)

### Catalog Page
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/en/catalog`  
**Status:** ✅ Loading successfully

**Verified:**
- ✅ Page loads without errors
- ✅ React Query fetching data
- ✅ 986 gemstones displaying
- ✅ Filters present (Type, Color, Cut, Clarity, Origin)
- ✅ Price and weight range sliders working
- ✅ Pagination showing (Page 1 of 42)

### Manual Test Cases

#### TC1: Basic Filter Functionality ✅
- [x] Type dropdown opens
- [x] Color dropdown opens
- [x] Cut dropdown opens
- [x] Clarity dropdown opens
- [x] Origin dropdown opens
- [x] Price slider moves
- [x] Weight slider moves
- [x] "In Stock Only" checkbox toggles

#### TC2: Filter Application
- [ ] Select gemstone type → results update
- [ ] Select color → results update
- [ ] Select cut → results update
- [ ] Combine multiple filters → results update
- [ ] Clear filters → show all results

#### TC3: React Query Caching
- [ ] Navigate away and back → instant load (cached)
- [ ] Open devtools → verify cache hits
- [ ] Change filter → new query
- [ ] Return to previous filter → cache hit

#### TC4: URL Synchronization
- [ ] Apply filter → URL updates
- [ ] Refresh page → filters preserved
- [ ] Share URL → filters load correctly
- [ ] Browser back/forward → filters sync

#### TC5: Pagination
- [ ] Click next page → loads page 2
- [ ] URL updates with page number
- [ ] Refresh → correct page loads
- [ ] Change filter → resets to page 1

#### TC6: Search
- [ ] Type in search box → debounced search
- [ ] Search term in URL
- [ ] Clear search → resets

## 🎯 Performance Testing

### React Query Cache Verification

**Expected Behavior:**
- First load: API call
- Cached load: No API call (instant)
- Stale time: 5 minutes
- GC time: 10 minutes

**Test:**
```javascript
// 1. Load catalog → API call #1
// 2. Navigate to detail page
// 3. Navigate back to catalog → NO API call (cache hit)
// 4. Change filter → API call #2
// 5. Revert filter → Cache hit (instant)
```

**Results:** (To be completed)
- [ ] Cache hits verified
- [ ] Stale time working
- [ ] GC time working
- [ ] No unnecessary re-fetches

## ⏭️ Next Steps

1. **Complete Manual Browser Testing:**
   - Test all filter combinations
   - Verify React Query cache behavior
   - Test URL synchronization
   - Test pagination

2. **Admin Component Testing:**
   - Test refactored admin component
   - Verify bulk edit works
   - Verify export works
   - Test admin-specific features

3. **E2E Test Creation** (Optional for Phase 1):
   - Create Playwright E2E tests
   - Automate filter testing
   - Automate cache testing

4. **Final Verification:**
   - Zero regressions checklist
   - Performance benchmarks
   - User acceptance criteria

---

## 📝 Notes

- All unit tests passing ✅
- Browser testing partially complete
- Need to verify React Query DevTools
- Need to test filter combinations thoroughly
- Admin component needs browser testing

**Estimated Time Remaining:** 1.5 hours  
**Priority:** Continue with manual browser testing
