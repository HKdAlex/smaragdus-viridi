# Phase AI Finalization - Milestone 1: Database Schema Verification

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Status:** ✅ PASSED

## Objective
Verify that the AI-extracted fields migration was successfully applied to the gemstones table and that the fallback view was created.

## Migration Applied
- **File:** `migrations/20251015_add_ai_extracted_fields.sql`
- **Migration Name:** `add_ai_extracted_fields_v3`
- **Applied via:** Supabase MCP

## Verification Tests

### Test 1: Column Creation
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'gemstones'
AND column_name LIKE 'ai_%'
ORDER BY column_name;
```

**Result:** ✅ PASSED
- 19 ai_* columns exist (including previously existing ones)
- New columns created:
  - `ai_weight_carats` (numeric)
  - `ai_length_mm` (numeric)
  - `ai_width_mm` (numeric)
  - `ai_depth_mm` (numeric)
  - `ai_color` (text)
  - `ai_clarity` (text)
  - `ai_cut` (text)
  - `ai_origin` (text)
  - `ai_treatment` (text)
  - `ai_quality_grade` (text)
  - `ai_extracted_date` (timestamptz)
  - `ai_extraction_confidence` (numeric)

### Test 2: View Creation
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT table_name, view_definition
FROM information_schema.views
WHERE table_name = 'gemstones_with_best_data';
```

**Result:** ✅ PASSED
- View `gemstones_with_best_data` successfully created
- Provides fallback logic: `COALESCE(manual_field, ai_field)`
- Includes `weight_source` field to track data origin

## Data Types Verified
- ✅ NUMERIC fields for measurements (weight_carats, length_mm, width_mm, depth_mm)
- ✅ TEXT fields for descriptive data (color, clarity, cut, origin, treatment, quality_grade)
- ✅ TIMESTAMPTZ for ai_extracted_date
- ✅ NUMERIC(4,3) for ai_extraction_confidence (0-1 scale)

## Challenges Encountered
1. **Enum Type Mismatch:** Original columns `color`, `clarity`, and `cut` are enum types (`gem_color`, `gem_clarity`, `gem_cut`). Fixed by casting to text: `g.color::text`
2. **Origin Field:** The `origin` field doesn't exist as a direct column (it's a foreign key `origin_id`). Removed from view to avoid complexity.

## Next Steps
- ✅ Proceed to Phase 2: Data Extraction Logic
- Create `data-extractor.mjs` service
- Update `database-operations.mjs` to populate new fields
