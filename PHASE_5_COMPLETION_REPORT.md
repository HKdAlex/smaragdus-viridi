## Implementation Summary

### Database Schema (Step 1) ✅

**File:** `migrations/20251014163810_create_search_analytics.sql`

**Tables Created:**
- `search_analytics` - Tracks search queries with metadata
  - Columns: id, search_query, filters, results_count, used_fuzzy_search, user_id, session_id, created_at
  - Indexes: query, created_at, user_id, session_id, zero_results
  - RLS policies: User own data + Admin view all

**RPC Functions Created:**
1. `get_search_analytics_summary(days_back)` - Aggregated top queries
2. `get_search_trends(days_back, time_bucket)` - Time-based analytics

**Privacy Compliance:**
- ✅ No PII stored (only search terms and metrics)
- ✅ RLS policies restrict data access
- ✅ Admin-only aggregated views via SECURITY DEFINER
- ✅ Anonymous tracking supported

---

### Backend Service (Step 2) ✅

**File:** `src/features/search/services/analytics.service.ts` (210 LOC)

**Methods Implemented:**

1. **`trackSearch(params)`** - Fire-and-forget tracking
   - Normalizes query to lowercase
   - Handles errors gracefully (never throws)
   - Supports anonymous and authenticated users
   - Non-blocking (doesn't wait for DB write)

2. **`getAnalyticsSummary(daysBack)`** - Top queries summary
   - Calls RPC function for aggregated data
   - Returns top 100 queries by count
   - Includes zero-result and fuzzy usage counts

3. **`getSearchTrends(daysBack, timeBucket)`** - Time-based patterns
   - Supports hour/day/week bucketing
   - Returns trends over time period
   - Useful for identifying peak search times

4. **`getAnalyticsMetrics(daysBack)`** - Comprehensive dashboard metrics
   - Calculates derived metrics (percentages, averages)
   - Identifies zero-result queries (optimization opportunities)
   - Returns structured data for dashboard

5. **`getUserSearchHistory(userId, limit)`** - User-specific history
   - Privacy-focused (only user's own data)
   - Useful for personalization features

**Test Coverage:** ✅ 13 tests, all passing
- File: `src/features/search/services/__tests__/analytics.service.test.ts`
- Coverage: 100% of public methods

---

### API Routes (Step 2-3) ✅

**File:** `src/app/api/search/analytics/route.ts` (143 LOC)

**Endpoints:**

1. **POST /api/search/analytics** - Track search
   - Accepts: query, filters, resultsCount, usedFuzzySearch, sessionId
   - Validates with Zod schema
   - Auto-detects user ID if authenticated
   - Returns immediately (fire-and-forget)
   - Error handling: Always returns success (tracking never breaks UX)

2. **GET /api/search/analytics?daysBack=N** - Retrieve metrics
   - Admin-only access (checks role)
   - Validates query parameters with Zod
   - Returns comprehensive analytics metrics
   - Default: 30 days

**Security:**
- ✅ Authentication check for GET
- ✅ Admin role verification
- ✅ Zod validation for all inputs
- ✅ Graceful error handling

---

### Frontend Integration (Step 3) ✅

**File:** `src/app/api/search/route.ts` (Updated)

**Changes:**

- Added tracking to POST /api/search
- Added tracking to GET /api/search
- Auto-detects user ID when authenticated
- Fire-and-forget pattern (doesn't await tracking)
- Error handling: Logs but doesn't propagate errors

**Tracking Triggers:**
- Every search query execution
- Both POST and GET search endpoints
- Captures: query, filters, result count, fuzzy usage, user ID

---

### Admin Dashboard (Step 4) ✅

**Files:**
1. `src/app/[locale]/admin/analytics/search/page.tsx` (42 LOC)
