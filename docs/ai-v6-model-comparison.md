# AI v6 Model Comparison: GPT-4o vs GPT-4o-mini

## Test Results (Gemstone: 11b90b26-b4c0-406f-b614-0332779ebded)

### GPT-4o (Current Default)
- **Text Generation Cost**: $0.0278
- **Text Generation Time**: 80.8s
- **Cut Detection**: ✅ Fast (~5-10s)
- **Primary Image Selection**: ✅ Fast (~5-10s)
- **Total Time**: ~90-100s
- **Success Rate**: 100%

### GPT-4o-mini
- **Text Generation Cost**: $0.0033 (~8x cheaper!)
- **Text Generation Time**: 71.9s
- **Cut Detection**: ✅ Fast (~5-10s, uses GPT-4o Vision)
- **Primary Image Selection**: ❌ Timeout after 60s
- **Total Time**: N/A (timeout)
- **Success Rate**: Partial (vision tasks timeout)

## Cost Breakdown

| Task | GPT-4o | GPT-4o-mini | Savings |
|------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Text Generation | $0.0278 | $0.0033 | 88% |
| Vision (Cut Detection) | Included | Uses GPT-4o | - |
| Vision (Primary Image) | Included | Timeout | - |
| **Total per Gemstone** | **$0.028** | **N/A** | - |

## Recommendation

### For Production: **GPT-4o** ✅

**Reasons:**
1. **Reliability**: 100% success rate for all tasks
2. **Speed**: Consistent ~90-100s total time
3. **Vision Performance**: Fast image analysis (cut detection, primary selection)
4. **Cost Efficiency**: $0.028/gemstone is reasonable for quality
5. **Simplicity**: Single model for all tasks

### Alternative Strategy (Not Recommended)

Use **GPT-4o for vision** + **GPT-4o-mini for text**:
- Potential savings: ~$0.025/gemstone
- Issues:
  - More complex pipeline
  - Mixed model management
  - Minimal cost savings (~10%)
  - Not worth the added complexity

## Conclusion

**Keep GPT-4o as the default model** for the v6 pipeline. The cost of $0.028 per gemstone is acceptable for:
- High-quality bilingual content
- Accurate image analysis
- Reliable performance
- Simplified architecture

For a catalog of 1,000 gemstones:
- Total cost: ~$28
- Time: ~25-30 hours (with proper batching and rate limiting)
- Quality: Consistent and production-ready
