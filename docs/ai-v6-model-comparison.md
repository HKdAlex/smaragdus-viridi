## Recommendation

### For Production: **GPT-4o-mini** ✅ (Updated)

**Reasons:**

1. **90% Cost Savings**: $0.0029 vs $0.0278 (GPT-4o) or $0.0667 (o4-mini)
2. **Fastest Performance**: 48.9s total time (40% faster than GPT-4o)
3. **100% Success Rate**: All tasks work perfectly (vision + text)
4. **Excellent Quality**: Same confidence levels as more expensive models
5. **Best at Scale**: Only $14.50 for 5,000 gems vs $139 (GPT-4o) or $334 (o4-mini)

### Why NOT o4-mini?

While o4-mini has marginally better primary image selection (0.75 vs 0.63):

- **23x more expensive** than gpt-4o-mini ($0.0667 vs $0.0029)
- Not worth the cost for minimal quality improvement
- Would cost $333.50 for 5,000 gems vs $14.50

### Why NOT GPT-4o?

While GPT-4o is reliable:

- **10x more expensive** than gpt-4o-mini ($0.0278 vs $0.0029)
- **Slower** (80.8s vs 48.9s)
- Same quality output as gpt-4o-mini

## Conclusion

**GPT-4o-mini is now the default model** for the v6 pipeline. The dramatic cost savings ($0.0029 per gemstone) make it ideal for:

- High-quality bilingual content generation
- Accurate image analysis (cut detection, primary selection)
- Fast and reliable performance
- Cost-effective scaling

For a catalog of 5,000 gemstones:

- Total cost: **$14.50** (vs $139 with GPT-4o)
- Time: ~70-80 hours (with proper batching and rate limiting)
- Quality: Production-ready and consistent
- **Savings: $124.50** compared to GPT-4o
