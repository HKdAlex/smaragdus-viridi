# Image Issues Resolution - Smaragdus Viridi

## üö® Issues Discovered

### **Problem 1: Wrong Content Images**

- **Issue**: Blue Topaz showing sneaker/shoe images instead of gemstones
- **Root Cause**: Unsplash image ID `1544376664-80b17f09d399` returns sneakers, not blue gemstones
- **Affected Gemstones**: All blue sapphires and blue diamond (5+ stones)

### **Problem 2: Dark/Invisible Images**

- **Issue**: Blue Topaz showing completely black/empty image
- **Root Cause**: Unsplash image ID `1578662996442-48f60103fc96` appears very dark or doesn't load properly
- **Affected Gemstones**: Blue tanzanites and replacement blue stones (8+ stones)

### **Problem 3: Color Mismatches**

- **Issue**: Blue topaz currently showing green emerald image
- **Root Cause**: Temporary fix applied, waiting for proper blue image

## üîß Long-term Solution Needed

### **Curated Image Library Required**

We need a manually curated and verified image library with:

1. **Verified Blue Gemstone Images**

   - Light blue sapphire
   - Dark blue sapphire
   - Blue topaz
   - Blue diamond
   - Blue tanzanite

2. **Property-Specific Images**

   - Different images for different cuts (round, princess, emerald, etc.)
   - Color-accurate representations
   - High-quality, professional photography

3. **Fallback Strategy**
