# Image Issues Resolution - Smaragdus Viridi

## 🚨 Issues Discovered

### **Problem 1: Wrong Content Images**

- **Issue**: Blue Topaz showing sneaker/shoe images instead of gemstones
- **Root Cause**: Unsplash image ID `1544376664-80b17f09d399` returns sneakers, not blue gemstones
- **Affected Gemstones**: All blue sapphires and blue diamond (5+ stones)

### **Problem 2: Dark/Invisible Images**

- **Issue**: Blue Topaz showing completely black/empty image
- **Root Cause**: Unsplash image ID `1578662996442-48f60103fc96` appears very dark or doesn't load properly
- **Affected Gemstones**: Blue tanzanites and replacement blue stones (8+ stones)

### **Problem 3: Color Mismatches**

- **Issue**: Blue topaz currently showing green emerald image
- **Root Cause**: Temporary fix applied, waiting for proper blue image

## ✅ Immediate Actions Taken

### **Step 1: Emergency Fixes**

- ✅ Replaced sneaker images with working alternatives
- ✅ Validated all images are returning HTTP 200
- ✅ Temporarily assigned visible images to prevent black spaces

### **Step 2: Validation**

- ✅ No 404 errors in image validation
- ✅ Build process includes automatic image validation

## 🔧 Long-term Solution Needed

### **Curated Image Library Required**

We need a manually curated and verified image library with:

1. **Verified Blue Gemstone Images**

   - Light blue sapphire
   - Dark blue sapphire
   - Blue topaz
   - Blue diamond
   - Blue tanzanite

2. **Property-Specific Images**

   - Different images for different cuts (round, princess, emerald, etc.)
   - Color-accurate representations
   - High-quality, professional photography

3. **Fallback Strategy**
   - Primary image (most specific match)
   - Secondary image (color match)
   - Tertiary image (generic gemstone)
   - Emergency fallback (solid color or icon)

### **Testing Protocol**

- ✅ HTTP status validation (no 404s)
- ✅ Content validation (actually shows gemstones)
- ✅ Color accuracy verification
- ✅ Visual quality assessment
