# Search Advanced Filters Integration - October 15, 2025

## Problem Solved

The advanced filters on the catalog page worked perfectly, but the same filters shown on the search results page were completely ignored.

### Before: Search Filters Were Ignored ❌

**Catalog page** (`/catalog`):

- ✅ Price range: `$100 - $5,000`
- ✅ Weight range: `1.0 - 2.0 carats`
- ✅ Type filters: `emerald`, `ruby`, etc.
- ✅ Color filters: `red`, `green`, etc.
- ✅ Cut/clarity filters
- ✅ In stock toggle

**Search results page** (`/search?q=emerald`):

- ❌ Same filters shown but **completely ignored**
- ❌ All results returned regardless of filter values
- ❌ No price, weight, or category filtering applied

## Root Cause

The search used a different database function (`search_gemstones_multilingual`) that only handled:

- ✅ Text search (full-text with fuzzy fallback)
- ✅ Locale/language switching
- ❌ **No advanced filters at all**

While the catalog used the API endpoint (`/api/catalog`) which processed all filters.

## Solution: Unified Advanced Filtering

### 1. Enhanced Search Database Function

Updated `search_gemstones_multilingual` to process all advanced filters:

```sql
-- Advanced filters (matching catalog API logic)
AND (min_price IS NULL OR g.price_amount >= min_price)
AND (max_price IS NULL OR g.price_amount <= max_price)
AND (min_weight IS NULL OR g.weight_carats >= min_weight)
AND (max_weight IS NULL OR g.weight_carats <= max_weight)
AND (types IS NULL OR cardinality(types) = 0 OR g.name::text = ANY(types))
AND (colors IS NULL OR cardinality(colors) = 0 OR g.color::text = ANY(colors))
AND (cuts IS NULL OR cardinality(cuts) = 0 OR g.cut::text = ANY(cuts))
AND (clarities IS NULL OR cardinality(clarities) = 0 OR g.clarity::text = ANY(clarities))
AND (origins_filter IS NULL OR cardinality(origins_filter) = 0 OR g.origin_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM origins WHERE name = ANY(origins_filter)
))
AND (in_stock_only IS NULL OR NOT in_stock_only OR g.in_stock = true)
AND (has_ai_analysis_filter IS NULL OR NOT has_ai_analysis_filter OR g.ai_analyzed = true)
```

### 2. Consistent Business Logic

Search now applies the same filters as catalog:

- ✅ **Price > 0**: Always filter out zero-price gems
- ✅ **Has images**: Require at least one image
- ✅ **All advanced filters**: Price, weight, types, colors, cuts, clarities, origins, stock status, AI analysis

### 3. Fixed Column Name Conflicts

Resolved PostgreSQL parameter/column name conflicts by renaming function return columns:

```sql
-- Before: Conflicted with function parameters
id uuid, name gemstone_type

-- After: No conflicts
gemstone_id uuid, gemstone_name gemstone_type
```

Updated frontend mapping to handle both old and new column names.

## Testing Results

### ✅ Price Range Filtering

```sql
-- Search: emerald $10-50
SELECT gemstone_id, serial_number, gemstone_name, price_amount
FROM search_gemstones_multilingual('emerald', 'en',
  '{"minPrice": 1000, "maxPrice": 5000}'::jsonb, 1, 5);

-- Result: ✅ Returns 5 emeralds priced $11.20 - $46.80
```

### ✅ Weight Range Filtering

```sql
-- Search: emerald 1.0-2.0 carats
SELECT gemstone_id, serial_number, gemstone_name, weight_carats
FROM search_gemstones_multilingual('emerald', 'en',
  '{"minWeight": 1.0, "maxWeight": 2.0}'::jsonb, 1, 5);

-- Result: ✅ Returns 5 emeralds weighing 1.4 - 1.93 carats
```

### ✅ Color Filtering

```sql
-- Search: emerald + red color (impossible combination)
SELECT * FROM search_gemstones_multilingual('emerald', 'en',
  '{"colors": ["red"]}'::jsonb, 1, 5);

-- Result: ✅ Returns 0 results (correct - emeralds aren't red)
```

## Architecture Benefits

### 🎯 Unified Experience

- **Catalog** and **search** now use identical filtering logic
- Users get consistent results regardless of entry point
- No more "why don't these filters work on search?"

### 🚀 Performance

- Single database function handles all search scenarios
- Efficient filtering at database level (not in application)
- Maintains full-text search performance with advanced filters

### 🔧 Maintainability

- One source of truth for search filtering logic
- Easy to add new filters to both catalog and search
- Consistent business rules across the application

## Files Modified

1. **Database Function**: `migrations/20251015_add_multilingual_search.sql`

   - Added all advanced filter logic
   - Fixed column name conflicts
   - Enhanced with catalog-matching business rules

2. **Search Service**: `src/features/search/services/search.service.ts`

   - Updated column mapping for renamed return fields
   - Maintained backward compatibility

3. **Migration**: `migrations/20251015_add_multilingual_search.sql`
   - Updated to include advanced filtering capabilities

## Final Result

**Search now works exactly like catalog filtering!** 🎉

- ✅ Same filters, same logic, same results
- ✅ Price, weight, type, color, cut, clarity filtering
- ✅ Stock status, AI analysis, origins filtering
- ✅ Zero-price and no-image gems excluded
- ✅ Consistent user experience across the app

The search and catalog pages now provide a truly unified browsing experience.
