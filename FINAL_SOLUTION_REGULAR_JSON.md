# Final Solution: Regular JSON + Multi-Strategy Extractor

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented & Testing

## The Journey

### What We Learned

After extensive testing with structured outputs (`json_schema`):

1. ✅ **Text-only:** GPT-4o/GPT-4o-mini work perfectly with schemas
2. ❌ **Vision + Images:** ALL models fail with schemas (even GPT-4o-mini!)
3. ✅ **Vision + Regular JSON:** Models return natural structured data

**Key Insight:** Structured outputs are fundamentally incompatible with vision models!

---

## The Solution

### 1. Use Regular JSON Mode

**No schema enforcement** - let the model return its natural structure:

```javascript
response_format: {
  type: "json_object";
}
```

### 2. Build Robust Multi-Strategy Extractor

Accept that different models return different structures - handle them all!

```javascript
export function extractGemstoneData(data) {
  // Strategy 1: aggregated_data / consolidated_data
  if (data.aggregated_data || data.consolidated_data) {
    return extractFromAggregated(...);
  }

  // Strategy 2: individual_analyses array
  if (data.individual_analyses) {
    return extractFromIndividualAnalyses(...);
  }

  // Strategy 3: Flexible search
  return extractFlexible(data);
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Strategy 1: Aggregated Data

Handles models that provide consolidated summaries:

```javascript
{
  "aggregated_data": {
    "weight_ct": 1.86,
    "color": "vivid violet-blue",
    "shape_cut": "octagonal"
  }
}
```

### Strategy 2: Individual Analyses

**This is what GPT-5-mini returns!**

```javascript
{
  "individual_analyses": [
    {
      "index": 1,
      "measurements": {
        "weight_ct": { "value": 1.86, "confidence": 0.95 }
      },
      "visual_observations": "vivid violet-blue color, octagonal cut"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Extractor Features:**

- Selects best measurement by confidence
- Extracts color/cut from text via regex
- Calculates aggregate confidence

### Strategy 3: Flexible Search

Searches entire JSON tree for fields when structure is non-standard.

## Model Configuration

### Production Model: GPT-5-mini

**Why:**

- ✅ Good vision capabilities
- ✅ Returns structured `individual_analyses`
- ✅ Cost-effective (~$0.03/gemstone)
- ✅ Works with regular JSON mode

**Settings:**

```javascript
const VISION_MODEL = "gpt-5-mini";
response_format: {
  type: "json_object";
}
```

---

## Expected Results

### Before (Structured Outputs)

```
Field Extraction: 0-8%
Model: ANY (all fail with vision)
Cost: $0.03-0.06/gemstone
```

### After (Regular JSON + Multi-Strategy)

```
Field Extraction: Target 60-90%
Model: gpt-5-mini
Cost: ~$0.03/gemstone
```

**Realistic Targets:**

- Weight: 80%+ (when scale visible)
- Dimensions: 50-70% (when gauge visible)
- Color: 90%+ (visual analysis)
- Cut: 80%+ (visual analysis)
- Confidence: 70-95%

## Files Changed

### Core Logic

1. **`scripts/ai-analysis/multi-image-processor.mjs`**

   - Changed: `response_format: { type: "json_object" }`
   - Removed: json_schema imports and usage
   - Model: `gpt-5-mini` (default)

2. **`scripts/ai-analysis/data-extractor.mjs`**
   - Added: 3-strategy extraction system
   - Added: `extractFromIndividualAnalyses()` - parses array format
   - Added: `getBestMeasurement()` - selects highest confidence
   - Added: `extractFlexible()` - searches entire JSON tree
   - Added: Regex extraction for color/cut from text

### Documentation

1. **`REGULAR_JSON_MODE_SOLUTION.md`**

   - Explains why structured outputs don't work
   - Documents regular JSON mode approach

2. **`VISION_STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_LIMITATION.md`**
   - Details the vision API limitation
   - Provides evidence from tests

## Testing Status

### Current Test

⏳ Running: `test-improved-extractor-v2.log`

- Model: gpt-5-mini
- Format: Regular JSON (no schema)
- Extractor: Multi-strategy (new)
- Gemstones: 3 (different from previous tests)

### Success Criteria

- ✅ API calls succeed (regular JSON works)
- ⏳ Extractor finds `individual_analyses`
- ⏳ Extracts measurements from array
- ⏳ Extracts color/cut from text
- ⏳ Field extraction: >60% (realistic target)

---

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Validate (Now)

1. ⏳ Review test results
2. ⏳ Check extraction rate
3. ⏳ Analyze which fields are extracted
4. ⏳ Identify any missing patterns

### Phase 2: Enhance Extractor

Based on test results:

- Add more regex patterns for color/cut
- Handle additional field name variations
- Improve confidence calculation
- Add more fallback paths

### Phase 3: Production Deployment

1. Test on 10-50 gemstones
2. Verify acceptable extraction rate (>60%)
3. Deploy to full catalog (1385 gems)
4. Monitor and iterate

---

## Cost Analysis

### Per Gemstone (14 images average)

- API Cost: ~$0.03
- Total for 1385 gems: ~$42

### Value Proposition

- ✅ Automated metadata extraction
- ✅ Multilingual descriptions
- ✅ Primary image selection
- ✅ Quality confidence scores
- ✅ Fills gaps in manual data

**ROI:** Excellent - saves hours of manual data entry!

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test with Real Data**

   - Text-only tests mislead us
   - Vision models behave differently
   - Always test the actual use case

2. **Don't Fight the API**

   - Structured outputs looked perfect on paper
   - Reality: vision API doesn't support them
   - Solution: Work with what the model naturally returns

3. **Build Robust Parsers**

   - Models return different structures
   - Single-format extractors are fragile
   - Multi-strategy approach handles variation

4. **Iterate Based on Evidence**
   - We tried: GPT-5, GPT-4o, strict mode, simple schema
   - We learned: None work with vision
   - We adapted: Regular JSON + flexible extraction

---

**Bottom Line:** The best API is one that actually works. Regular JSON + multi-strategy extraction = practical, working solution. 🎯
