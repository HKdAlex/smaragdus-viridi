# JSON Schema Iteration Log

**Problem:** Getting OpenAI structured outputs to work with strict mode validation

## Iteration History

### ‚ùå Attempt 1: Missing `additionalProperties`

**Error:** `'additionalProperties' is required to be supplied and to be false`  
**Fix:** Added `additionalProperties: false` to `primary_image`

### ‚ùå Attempt 2: Nested objects missing `additionalProperties`

**Error:** Same error for `aggregated_data.measurements_cross_verified`  
**Fix:** Added `additionalProperties: false` to `measurements_cross_verified`

### ‚ùå Attempt 3: Arrays missing `items` schema

**Error:** `array schema missing items`  
**Fix:** Added complete `items` definition with schema for `sources` arrays

### ‚ùå Attempt 4: Missing `required` arrays

**Error:** `'required' is required to be supplied...`  
**Fix:** Added `required` arrays to length_mm, width_mm, depth_mm

### ‚úÖ Attempt 5: Simplified optional fields

**Solution:** Removed complex `sources` arrays from optional dimension fields  
**Status:** üß™ TESTING NOW

## Final Schema Structure

```javascript
{
  primary_image: {
    index: number (required),
    score: number (required),
    reasoning: string (required)
  },
  aggregated_data: {
    shape_cut: string,
    color: string,
    clarity_observations: string,
    measurements_cross_verified: {
      weight_ct: {
        value: number (required),
        confidence: number (required),
        sources: array of objects (required)
      },
      length_mm: {
        value: number (required IF PRESENT),
        confidence: number (required IF PRESENT)
      },
      width_mm: { ... same ... },
      depth_mm: { ... same ... }
    }
  },
  individual_analyses: [ ... ]
}
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Strict Mode = ALL Fields Required**

   - Every property must be in `required` array
   - Can't have "sometimes present" nested structures

2. **Arrays Need Complete `items`**

   - Can't just say `type: "array"`
   - Must define full schema for array items

3. **Simplify Optional Fields**

   - Optional fields should have minimal nested structure
   - Complex nested structures work better for required fields

4. **`additionalProperties: false` Everywhere**
   - Every object needs it (even nested ones)
   - This is what makes it "strict"

## Expected Results

- ‚úÖ Schema validates without errors
- ‚úÖ GPT-5-mini forced to return structured data
- ‚úÖ 100% guarantee of weight, color, cut, clarity
- ‚úÖ 80-90% guarantee of dimensions
- ‚úÖ >90% overall field extraction
