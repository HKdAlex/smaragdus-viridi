# Customer Orders Page - Ultimate UI Implementation Plan

## 🚀 PHASE PLANNING & REALITY CHECK

### Current State Analysis ✅ COMPLETED

**REALITY CHECK FINDINGS:**

1. **Individual Order Page**: ✅ EXISTS

   - Shows detailed order information with tracking
   - Uses `OrderDetailsWrapper` component

2. **Orders History Component**: ✅ EXISTS
   - Location: `src/features/user/components/order-history.tsx`  
   - Comprehensive with search/filter functionality
   - Currently only accessible via profile page tab

3. **Orders Services**: ✅ EXISTS
   - Order tracking service: `src/features/orders/services/order-tracking-service.ts`
   - User profile service with order history: `src/features/user/services/user-profile-service.ts`
