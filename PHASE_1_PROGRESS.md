# Phase 1: Filter Refactoring + React Query - Progress Report

**Date**: 2025-10-13  
**Status**: Steps 1-3 Complete (3.5 hours of 10 hours)

---

## âœ… Completed Steps

### Step 1: React Query Provider (30 min) âœ…

- âœ… Created `src/lib/react-query/provider.tsx` with QueryProvider and devtools
- âœ… Modified `src/app/layout.tsx` to wrap app with QueryProvider
- âœ… Verified React Query initialization in browser
- **Commit**: `cb29074`

### Step 2: React Query Hooks (1 hour) âœ…

- âœ… Created `use-gemstone-query.ts` - React Query wrapper for gemstones
  - 5min staleTime, 10min gcTime
  - Automatic caching and background refetching
  - Uses GemstoneFetchService from Phase 0
- âœ… Created `use-filter-counts-query.ts` - React Query wrapper for filter counts
  - 10min staleTime (options change infrequently)
  - 30min gcTime for longer cache retention
  - Auto-aggregates raw counts into structured options
- **Commit**: `cb29074`

### Step 3: Simplified Filter State (1.5 hours) âœ…

- âœ… Created `use-filter-state.ts` - Pure filter state management
  - No URL coupling (single responsibility)
  - Easy to test
  - Returns: filters, updateFilters, setFilters, resetFilters, filterCount, hasFilters
- âœ… Created `use-filter-url-sync.ts` - Separate URL synchronization
  - Debounced updates (100ms)
  - Can be enabled/disabled independently
  - Handles browser back/forward
- **Commit**: `cb29074`

**Total Time**: 3 hours  
**Files Created**: 6  
**Lines of Code**: 364

## ðŸ”„ Current Challenge

**Issue**: Existing filter components (`AdvancedFilters`, `AdvancedFiltersV2`) are tightly coupled with `use-advanced-filters` hook (485 LOC) which manages its own internal state and URL sync.

**Problem**: To properly refactor, we need to:

1. Make filter components controlled (no internal state)
2. Remove `use-advanced-filters` dependency
3. Integrate with new `use-filter-state` + `use-filter-url-sync`
4. Maintain 100% feature parity

**Options**:

1. **Full Refactor** (remaining 7 hours): Completely rewrite filter components as controlled components
   - Pros: Clean architecture, follows plan exactly
   - Cons: High risk, complex, time-consuming
2. **Pragmatic Integration** (remaining 4 hours): Keep existing filters, integrate React Query in catalog
   - Pros: Lower risk, faster, maintains functionality
   - Cons: Defers full filter refactoring to future iteration
3. **Hybrid Approach** (remaining 5-6 hours): Refactor catalog + one filter component, document pattern
   - Pros: Shows path forward, partial benefits
   - Cons: Mixed architecture temporarily

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation

Given that:

- Phase 0 already created reusable services (GemstoneFetchService, QueryBuilderService, FilterAggregationService)
- React Query is now integrated and working
- The site is not live (no rush)
- Filter system is complex (485 LOC hook + 2 filter components)

**Recommended Path**: Option 1 - Full Refactor

But breaking it into smaller, verifiable steps:

### Revised Step 4-5 Plan

**Step 4a**: Refactor Catalog Component (2 hours)

- Use React Query hooks instead of custom fetch/cache
- Keep existing filter integration temporarily
- Verify everything works

**Step 4b**: Create Controlled Filter POC (2 hours)

- Create one controlled filter component as example
- Document pattern clearly
- Test integration

**Step 4c**: Refactor Remaining Filters (3 hours)

- Apply pattern to all filter components
- Remove use-advanced-filters hook
- Comprehensive testing

This gives us checkpoints and reduces risk.

## ðŸ“‹ Next Actions

**Immediate** (Choose one):

1. Continue with pragmatic approach (faster, lower risk)
2. Pause to discuss approach with stakeholder
3. Continue with full refactor as planned (higher quality, longer time)

**Your preference?**
