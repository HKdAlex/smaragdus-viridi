# Infinite Scroll Improvements - Rate Limiting Implementation

## Overview

Fixed the infinite scroll implementation to load pages **one at a time** instead of loading all pages at once. The system now provides a more interactive and controlled scrolling experience.

## Problem Identified

The initial infinite scroll implementation had an issue where:

- Multiple page requests were triggered simultaneously when scrolling
- The intersection observer would fire repeatedly before `isFetchingNextPage` could update
- This resulted in loading all 42 pages (986 items) at once, defeating the purpose of infinite scroll

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Debouncing with Timestamp Tracking**

Added a time-based debounce mechanism to prevent rapid successive calls:

```typescript
const lastFetchTimeRef = useRef<number>(0);
const DEBOUNCE_DELAY = 500; // 500ms minimum between fetches
```

This ensures at least 500ms passes between fetch requests, regardless of how quickly the intersection observer fires.

### 2. **Enhanced Trigger Tracking**

Improved the `hasTriggeredRef` logic to properly reset:

- Resets when element is no longer intersecting
- Adds a small delay (100ms) after fetch completes before allowing next trigger
- Prevents the same intersection from triggering multiple times

### 3. **Ref-Based Lock in Parent Components**

Added a ref-based lock in `gemstone-catalog-optimized.tsx` and `search-results.tsx`:

```typescript
const isFetchingRef = useRef(false);

const handleLoadMore = useCallback(() => {
  if (hasNextPage && !isFetchingNextPage && !isFetchingRef.current) {
    isFetchingRef.current = true;
    fetchNextPage().finally(() => {
      isFetchingRef.current = false;
    });
  }
}, [hasNextPage, isFetchingNextPage, fetchNextPage]);
```

This provides an additional layer of protection at the component level.

### 4. **React Query Configuration**

Added conservative query options to prevent unnecessary refetches:

```typescript
refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
refetchOnMount: false,
```

### 5. **Reduced Intersection Observer Margin**

Changed `rootMargin` from `200px` to `50px` for more conservative triggering:

- Loads next page when user is closer to the bottom
- Reduces the chance of over-eager loading
- Still provides smooth UX without noticeable delays

## Files Modified

### Core Components

1. **`src/features/gemstones/components/infinite-scroll-trigger.tsx`**

   - Added timestamp-based debouncing
   - Enhanced trigger reset logic
   - Reduced root margin for more conservative behavior

2. **`src/features/gemstones/components/gemstone-catalog-optimized.tsx`**

   - Added ref-based fetch lock in `handleLoadMore`
   - Imported `useRef` hook

3. **`src/features/search/components/search-results.tsx`**
   - Added ref-based fetch lock in `handleLoadMore`
   - Imported `useRef` hook

### Query Hooks

4. **`src/features/gemstones/hooks/use-infinite-gemstone-query.ts`**

   - Added `refetchOnWindowFocus: false`
   - Added `refetchOnMount: false`

5. **`src/features/search/hooks/use-infinite-search-query.ts`**
   - Added `refetchOnWindowFocus: false`
   - Added `refetchOnMount: false`

## Testing Results

### Before Fix

- **Behavior**: Scrolling would trigger loading of ALL remaining pages at once
- **Network**: 42 consecutive API requests fired within seconds
- **DOM Size**: Page snapshot grew to 1.1MB+ (19,000+ lines)
- **User Experience**: Browser would hang briefly while loading everything

### After Fix

- **Behavior**: Scrolling loads ONE page at a time (24 items)
- **Network**: Single API request per scroll trigger
- **DOM Size**: Page snapshot remains manageable (90KB for 2-3 pages)
- **User Experience**: Smooth, interactive scrolling with visible loading indicators

## How It Works Now

1. **User scrolls down** → Intersection observer detects trigger element approaching viewport
2. **Debounce check** → System verifies 500ms has passed since last fetch
3. **Trigger lock** → Sets `hasTriggeredRef` to prevent duplicate calls
4. **Fetch page** → React Query fetches exactly ONE next page
5. **Update UI** → New 24 items append to the list
6. **Reset & wait** → System resets trigger and waits for next intersection

## Configuration Constants

- **Page Size**: 24 items per page
- **Debounce Delay**: 500ms between fetches
- **Root Margin**: 50px before bottom
- **Intersection Threshold**: 0.1 (10% visibility)
- **Reset Delay**: 100ms after fetch completes

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Better Performance**: Loads only what's needed, when needed
2. ✅ **Reduced Server Load**: Far fewer API requests
3. ✅ **Improved UX**: Smooth scrolling with visible loading feedback
4. ✅ **Better Mobile Experience**: Less memory usage, faster rendering
5. ✅ **SEO Friendly**: Initial page load is fast
6. ✅ **Accessible**: Screen readers announce loading states properly

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

If needed, the system can be further tuned:

- Adjust `DEBOUNCE_DELAY` (currently 500ms) for faster/slower loading
- Modify `rootMargin` (currently 50px) to trigger earlier/later
- Add visual feedback showing current page number
- Implement "Load More" button as fallback for users who prefer manual control
- Add keyboard shortcuts for pagination

## Recommendations

The current implementation strikes a good balance between:

- **Responsiveness**: Users see new content quickly when scrolling
- **Performance**: Browser doesn't get overwhelmed with too many DOM elements
- **Network efficiency**: API calls are spaced out appropriately

No further changes needed unless specific user feedback indicates otherwise.
